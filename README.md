This project was completed in line with my 3rd year university assignment - I was tasked with solving a real world issues.
I chose to create an online stores system to provide the uni with an online alternative to the current in person stores.

The front end was coded using HTML, CSS, React.js, Redux and Redux Thunk and Axios.

The back-end portion is also uploaded for viewing.
